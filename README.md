,

and rate my work.

This colorful design gave me the inspiration for the work.

The project was created on the basis of Bem's methodology.


<strong>In this project, such technologies were used as:</strong>
    
  •	 <strong>HTML ( cross-browsing and valid code)</strong>
  
  •	 <strong>CSS</strong>
  
    o	flex
    
    o grid (universal block construction scheme)
    
    o	modules
    
    o	responsive technologes
    
  •	 <strong>SCSS</strong>
  
    o	variables
    
    o	mixins
    
    o	extends
    
    o	and other
  
   •<strong>javaScript initial.</strong>


The transition between the main page and the menu is implemented exclusively on the capabilities of HTML and CSS.

The website is fully responsive and maintains all functionality for all gadgets.

Thank you for devoting a little time and positive emotions to my work)
